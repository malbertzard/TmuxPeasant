# TmuxPeasant
 A tool to work with git and tmux repos for the peasant that doesn't have fzf

Inspired by [ThePrimagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer) and his tool sessionizer

This does not use fzf. I handle all inputs with linux core utils. So it should run pretty much anywhere as long as tmux is installed.
